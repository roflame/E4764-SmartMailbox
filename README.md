# E4764-SmartMailbox
Repo for final project in EECS E4764 IoT - Intelligent and Connected Systems, Fall 2021, Columbia University.

Everything should run if you run Combined2 (1).py

To allow the data with mailbox records to be stored on Google Sheets, you will need a credentials file from Google Cloud Platform Google Sheets API. You should download it, rename it to client_secrets.json, and store it in the same directory as Combined2 (1).py.
A test.pkl file will be created that will hold the dataframe with updated mailbox records.

								<h2 class="alt">Intelligent and Connected Mailbox (ICM)</h2>
								<p>The ICM is Group 2's submission for the final project of the course EECS E4764 in the Fall '21 semester at Columbia University.</p>
								<p>It is very common nowadays to receive mail in your mailbox that was not sent to the right address, or mail that was meant for older tenants who have moved home since. Instead of the owner having to bear the responsibility of forwarding the wrong mail themselves, we came up with a device called the ICM that can inform the deliverer of its incorrectness without having to bother the owner. The device will read the text directly off an envelope and determine whether the mail has reached the correct person. If it is correct, it will accept the mail, notify the user via text message that they have new mail, attempt to categorize it as spam or not spam for better organization, and even create graphs to visualize mail trends and other statistics. If it is incorrect, it will reject the mail and notify the deliverer to return the mail to its sender.

							<p align="center">The ICM is a consumer-facing device that not only improves efficiency and organization, but also helps secure your mail by instantly notifying the user when they have new mail. By automatically categorizing the mail and rejecting incorrect ones, the ICM aims to emulate a system similar to e-mail and save its owner plenty of time. The product’s market can be targeted towards suburban or rural households where each homeowner wouldn’t purchase a large device like Amazon Hub. It can also be a great help towards people with various disabilities or sensory impairments by being able to notify them when they get new mail and automatically help them categorize and send back incorrect mail.</p>

									<p>Block Diagram for the ICM system</p>
							</article>
							
							<p align="left">The ICM mainly functions based on 4 components: Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization on the Cloud.</p>

							<h3 align="left">Embedded Systems</h3>

							<p align="left">A Raspberry Pi 4 is used as our main processing unit with the remaining various components mounted around the box. The owner attaches a USB drive containing a .txt file with their name on it.
								When a new envelope is put into the box, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) detects the change in light intensity and realizes that a piece of mail has been received.</br>
								An ESP32 CAM camera module <a href="#references" id="references-link" class="skel-layers-ignoreHref">[1]</a> attached to an FTDI interface is used to take a picture of the envelope and save it onto a localhost web server. The picture is retrieved from the server by our Raspberry Pi, after which the Computer Vision (CV) component takes over.</br>
								After the CV component compares the detected name on the envelope and the user’s name on the drive, if they are the same (within a preset 70% accuracy range), a Servo Motor <a href="#references" id="references-link" class="skel-layers-ignoreHref">[2]</a> turns to open up a flap and accept the mail and let it fall into the box, while a Green LED indicates to the deliverer that the mail has been accepted.</br>
								If the comparison determines that the mail has not reached the correct person, a Red LED indicates to the deliverer to take out the mail and return it to the sender.

							<h3 align="left">Computer Vision</h3>

							<p align="left">After an image is taken by the camera, the Raspberry Pi tries to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the image to get text on which we can perform comparisons and classification. In order to get OCR text output, the algorithm has to first grab an outline of the mailpiece from the entire image and transform the image to fit the envelope.</br>
							To do this, we use Computer Vision techniques to grey the image, blur the image, and then find the edges of the envelope in the image. We can then find the outline of the envelope and draw the contours to crop the image to that bounding box. After the image is transformed, we then color the image RGB and apply enhancements to the image such as increasing Contrast and Sharpness to help get more accurate OCR results.</br>

							<article class="item">
								<img src="images/7-enhanced.jpg" width="338" height="450" alt="" />
									<h4>Enhanced Image</h4>
							</article>
							The algorithm then attempts to recognize words in the image and convert them to text <a href="#references" id="references-link" class="skel-layers-ignoreHref">[3]</a>. This text is parsed through Python Regular Expressions and split into names and addresses ignoring any other writing on the envelope. We determine which name and address is the senders vs receivers by splitting the image into sections since we can safely assume that in the US the sender's information is on the top left of the envelope and the receiver's information is in the middle.</br>

							</article>
							Finally, the Pi determines if the sender name, sender address, receiver name and receiver address are coherent. If not, it tries various enhancements and rotations on image until comprehensible text is output. This output is saved into a text file on the Pi for use my the Machine Learning component.</p>

							<h3 align="left">Machine Learning</h3>

							<p align="left">
							As one may have experienced, spam mails are abundant and can be a nuisance. This is why we have employed machine learning to detect spam mail from non-spam mail. 
							A k-nearest neighbors classifier was chosen to complete this task. Mail was categorized as spam or not based on a publically available dataset of spam keywords <a href="#references" id="references-link" class="skel-layers-ignoreHref">[4]</a>.
							Specific examples of 'spammy' mail was added to the dataset to fulfill our goals and refine the model. After data preprocessing and model training, the k-NN model was able to determine spam/not with an accuracy of 92%.
							Finally, using the Twilio text messaging API <a href="#references" id="references-link" class="skel-layers-ignoreHref">[5]</a>, a text message notifying the user of new mail and if that mail was spam/not is sent, along with a link to view the data visualization stats.

							<h3 align="left">Data Visualization on the Cloud</h3>

							<p align="left">After filtering to check if the receiver name matches the name of the mailbox user, as explained in the previous section, all mail records are stored in a dataframe that is then sent to Google Sheets.
									This was done by storing all the records in a dictionary and then, after the prediction result, updating the dictionary with the result and storing it in a pickle file each time a new result comes in.
									The next step was to enable the Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs on Google Cloud Platform to be able to send the updated dataframe for storage on Google Sheets <a href="#references" id="references-link" class="skel-layers-ignoreHref">[6]</a>. 
									Using another cloud-based tool, the data visualization was done. Google DataStudio was used to pull the data from Google Sheets and perform various visualizations that turns the raw data into useful information for the user to understand.
									Full data visualization results are in the <a href="#results" id="results-link" class="skel-layers-ignoreHref">Results</a> section below.
